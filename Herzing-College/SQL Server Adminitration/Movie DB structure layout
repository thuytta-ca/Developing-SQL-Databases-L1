EXERCISES (MOVIES)
1. Use CREATE TABLE commands to describe all the tables in the Movies da¬tabase to SQL. The information you will need is shown in Figure 2.5. This information is rather generic (for example, the use of "Numeric" for numbers rather than something specific such as DECIMAL, INTEGER, or SMALLINT). Feel free to use any type provided by your implementation of SQL that will allow implementing numbers with the indicated sizes.

2.	Add all the directors shown in Figure 1.5 to the DIRECTOR table using the INSERT command. (Watch out for the nulls. Remember that you must use a special form of the INSERT command.)
3.	Add the remaining data shown in Figures 1.6 through 1.10 to the other tables in the Movies database. You can use the INSERT command for this. If your system has a simpler way to add data, however, feel free to use it.
